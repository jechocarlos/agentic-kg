            # Payment API v2.0
            
            ## Overview
            The Payment API allows applications to process credit card transactions.
            
            ## Authentication
            Use Bearer tokens for authentication. The authenticate() function returns a JWT token.
            
            ## Endpoints
            
            ### POST /api/payments
            Creates a new payment transaction.
            
            **Parameters:**
            - amount: decimal (required)
            - currency: string (required) 
            - card_token: string (required)
            
            **Response:**
            Returns a Payment object with transaction_id and status.
            
            ### GET /api/payments/{id}
            Retrieves payment details by transaction ID.
            
            ## Classes
            
            ### PaymentProcessor
            Main class for handling payment operations.
            - process_payment(amount, card) -> Transaction
            - validate_card(card_number) -> boolean
            - generate_receipt(transaction) -> Receipt
            
            ### Transaction
            Represents a payment transaction.
            - id: string
            - amount: decimal
            - status: string (pending, completed, failed)
            - created_at: datetime
            
            ## Dependencies
            PaymentProcessor depends on CreditCardValidator and DatabaseManager.
            The API requires Redis for session management and PostgreSQL for data storage.

            # Efficacy of Novel Diabetes Treatment Protocol

            ## Abstract
            This study evaluates the effectiveness of a new diabetes management protocol combining metformin with lifestyle interventions.
            
            ## Introduction
            Type 2 diabetes affects millions worldwide. Current treatments include metformin, insulin, and lifestyle modifications. Our research investigates a novel combined approach.
            
            ## Methodology
            
            ### Participants
            We recruited 200 patients with Type 2 diabetes from three medical centers:
            - University Medical Center (n=75)
            - City General Hospital (n=65) 
            - Regional Health Clinic (n=60)
            
            ### Treatment Protocol
            Patients received:
            1. Metformin 500mg twice daily
            2. Weekly counseling sessions with nutritionist Jane Thompson
            3. Exercise program supervised by Dr. Alex Kim
            4. Blood glucose monitoring every 2 weeks
            
            ### Measurements
            Primary outcome: HbA1c levels at 6 months
            Secondary outcomes: BMI, blood pressure, patient satisfaction
            
            ## Results
            Mean HbA1c decreased from 8.2% to 6.8% (p<0.001).
            85% of patients achieved target HbA1c <7%.
            Significant weight loss observed (mean -12 lbs).
            
            ## Discussion
            The combined protocol shows superior efficacy compared to metformin alone.
            Dr. Chen's previous research (2022) supports these findings.
            Limitations include short follow-up period and single-center design.
            
            ## Conclusion
            This novel protocol offers promise for improved diabetes management.
            Further research is needed to validate long-term effects.
